## Installation

TODO

## Usage

To use **parrot** with your project, you first have to initialize it:

```sh
parrot init
```

This will create a `.parrot` folder that will hold all your snapshots. You can then add your first snapshot:

```sh
parrot add 'echo "Hello, world!"'
```

**parrot** will show you a preview of the snapshot and ask for confirmation. If you decide to save the snapshot **parrot** will open your favorite editor, there you can edit the description file: the first line will be used as the snapshot name, the rest as description. Exit your editor and you're good, you've created your first snapshot.

You can now check that your program's outputs didn't change with:

```sh
parrot run
```

For a more interactive experience, for instance while developing, you can open **parrot**'s REPL with:

```sh
parrot
```

From there you can navigate snapshots and execute commands.

### Parrot commands

In REPL mode you have access to a few commands to interact with your snapshots, most commands have a 1 letter shorthand version to help you get things done faster.

Here is the list of available commands and their descriptions:

#### Quit (q)

```
quit
q
```

Quit parrot.

#### Help (h)

```
help
h
```

Display the commands cheat-sheet.

#### Filter (f)

```
filter <name>
f <name>
f #<tag>
f ~
f +
f -
```

Apply a filter to the current view:
- `<name>`: Select all snapshots with a name containing `<name>`.
- `#<tag>`: Select all snapshots with the tag `<tag>`.
- `~`: Select all snapshots with 'waiting to be run' status.
- `+`: Select all snapshots with 'passed' status.
- `-`: Select all snapshots withh 'failed' status.

#### Clear (c)

```
clear
c
```

Remove all filters.

#### Run (r)

```
run
r
r *
```

Run the selected snapshot, or all snapshots in the current view if `*` is passed as argument.

#### Show (s)

```
show
s
s *
```

Show the selected snapshot, or all snapshots in the current view if `*` is passed as argument.

#### Edit (e)

```
edit
e
```

Edit the selected snapshot name or description.

#### Update (u)

```
update
u
u *
```

Update the selected snapshot by running the command and saving the new outputs. Update all the snapshots in the current view if `*` is passed as argument.

## Customization

To decide which editor to use, **parrot** looks at the `EDITOR` environment variable, you can change your default editor by setting this variable:

```sh
export EDITOR=nvim
```

## Current limitations

**parrot** is developed and tested on Linux, it should work on MacOS too (can someone confirm that?).
